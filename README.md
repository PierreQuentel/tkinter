Port of the GUI library tkinter for Brython.

The initial plan was to include it Brython standard distribution.

The adaptation of all tkinter widgets was either very difficult for some
widgets (eg Text), or impossible in the browser environment (blocking dialog
boxes).

For these reasons, the package is removed from Brython and created as a
distinct repository in case other developers wanted to resume its
development.
